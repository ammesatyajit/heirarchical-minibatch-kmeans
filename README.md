# Hierarchical Minibatch Kmeans
An implementation of hierarchical kmeans that uses mini-batches for increased efficiency for large datasets.

# Usage
Have the .npy files all in one directory to do kmeans over. Run the command:

```
python3 hkmeans_minibatch.minibatch_hkmeans.py -r [--root-feature-path] -p [--features-prefix] -b [--batch-size] -s [--save-dir] -c [--centroid-dir]
```
